Minecraft datapack that makes it so the loot from vault can be picked up only by the player who opened it

Tired of your items from vault being stolen by another player? This datapack makes it so the loot from vault can be picked up only by the player who opened it

Works in multiplayer (there is no reason to use it in singleplayer lol, but works too).
But if you set it up on your own computer (not on server), it will not work for host (he will be able to grab any items)

It is not recommended for 1 player to open multiple vaults at the same time to avoid any potential bugs

Version for 1.21-1.21.1 is the original one, and versions 1.21.2-1.21.4 may feel janky (but it`s not a lag)

There is also a simple config that allows you to make vaults reusable (off by default). If you want to turn it on, type `/function u_v_l:config` in chat and click `[Yes]`, to turn it off, click `[No]`

Feel free to use whenever you want, but may be problems with non-vanilla cores
